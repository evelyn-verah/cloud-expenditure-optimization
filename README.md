# Overview
This project focused on optimizing cloud expenditure and improving system reliability through advanced data analytics and applied machine learning. By analyzing software test reports, I built predictive models to anticipate potential system failures, significantly improving customer satisfaction.
Additionally, I automated ETL pipelines and developed visualization dashboards, resulting in a 10% improvement in cloud budgeting efficiency.
The approaches developed here are directly transferable to high-stakes financial applications such as mobile money systems, where proactive risk detection, automated monitoring, and secure cloud resource management are critical.

# Objectives
Predict potential system failures from software test data.
Enhance customer trust and satisfaction through increased reliability.
Automate data workflows (ETL) for scalable and repeatable insights.
Build dashboards for real-time monitoring of cloud costs and performance.
Achieve measurable cloud expenditure efficiency improvements.

# Methodology
